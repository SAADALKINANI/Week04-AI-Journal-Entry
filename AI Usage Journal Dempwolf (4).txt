AI Usage Journal

Week 4
This week I used AI a few times while working on week 04_exercises.ipynb. I was stuck on some small details in my class implementations. For example, I asked how to decide between using a regular method and a @property for borrowed_count in the Member class. I also asked about why my Shelf.add_title() method was returning None instead of True/False, which helped me realize I needed to explicitly return the values. Another time I asked for guidance on how to handle the BookCopy.checkin() method so it wouldn’t break if the book was already available. Finally, I asked why my Rating.average() test expected a result between 3.4 and 3.9 when my math gave me 4.0 — this helped me think about different ways averages can be calculated.

Overall, I mainly used AI for concept explanations and debugging hints
